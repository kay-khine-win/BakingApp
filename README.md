# The Baking App
The Baking app is made as a part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program. 
It allows Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. 
The user can select a recipe and see the steps in video. This app has adaptive UI for phone and tablet devices. 
The user can alo read selected recipe as a home screen widget.

## Project Overview

You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.
